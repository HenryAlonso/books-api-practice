# books-api-practice
Am aware my Books.java is called that instead of Book. The first time I made the Spring project, I had made a Books.java model and then I realized my mistake and changed it to Book but I got an error that said drc/main/java/com/henryalosno/java/mvc/models/Book did not exist and I couldn't do anything with the file. I deleted the project and all references and data to it and re made the Spring project again and called it Book.java but I got the same error. The only thing that even allowed my to type code in is by calling it something else and I just went with Books. It could be because I did save as to change the file name from Books to Book instead of Refractor>>Rename. Either way, the update and delete methods are good to go and next time, I'll be sure to pay attention to file names.
